++++++++++ ORIGINAL CONCEPT BELOW ++++++++++++++

Creating a model of the Normandy SR-2 from the Mass Effect using 3D printing, laser cutting and other methods.

The repo contains code and files for the 3D parts, wooden components, images documenting projects and other blue prints.

The body of the ship is made from plastic and wood. All pieces modeled by team, no downloads or prefabs. The ship will have a hatch on its underside, it can open and close with the use of a small motor. Along the length of the ship we integrate LEDs and LED arrays as decorative lighting.

Extra features - [subject to change]
- pain and varnish of all parts
- pivot stand for the ship

Modeling in Fusion 360:
- individually sculpted parts
- 3D printed

Decorative wood padding:
- laser cut
- paint and laquer

Mechanical parts:
- hatch for the under-part of the ship
- requires motor

Assembly of parts:
- glue - [subject to change]
- screws

LED light arrays:
- the fuselage will be decorated with LED arrays
- LEDs in the wing thruster objects - [subject to change]

Acoustic elements:
